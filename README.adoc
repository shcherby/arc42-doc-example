= Software Architecture Documentation Example with arc42 and C4 Model

This example shows how to use https://arc42.org/[arc42] in combination with the https://c4model.com/[C4 model] with the Documentation as Code technique.

It shows how to use the techniques described in https://www.workingsoftware.dev/software-architecture-documentation-the-ultimate-guide/[The ultimate Guide to Software Architecture Documentation].

Check out the deployed https://bitsmuggler.github.io/arc42-c4-software-architecture-documentation-example/[HTML build] provided on GitHub Pages.

Technologies involved:

* https://arc42.org/[arc42] to get the structure for the software architecture documentation
* https://c4model.com/[C4 Model] an "abstraction-first" approach to diagramming software architecture, based upon abstractions that reflect how software architects and developers think about and build software.
* https://structurizr.com/dsl[Structurizr DSL] to describe the https://c4model.com/[C4 Model] of the software system
* https://github.com/structurizr/cli[Structurizr CLI] a command line utility for Structurizr to export the https://plantuml.com/[PlantUML] diagrams from the C4 Model described in the Structurizr DSL
* https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc] as format to write the software architecture documentation
* https://doctoolchain.org[docToolchain] to generate the representations of the software architecture documentation written in https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc]. docToolchain makes use of  https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor[Asciidoctor].
* https://kroki.io[Kroki] to generate diagrams

== Prerequisites
==== Install docToolchain
* [docToolchain tutorial](https://doctoolchain.org/docToolchain/v2.0.x/020_tutorial/010_Install.html)
* configure path to structurizr main dsl file in the docToolchainConfig.groovy

==== Generate PlantUML from the structurizr using the docToolchain
https://doctoolchain.org/docToolchain/[docToolchain] uses the Structurizr CLI to generate the PlantUML diagrams from the C4 Model described in the Structurizr DSL.

[source, bash]
----
./dtcw exportStructurizr
----

== Generate the software architecture documentation representations

NOTE: these examples use the public https://kroki.io[kroki.io] instance to generate the diagrams.
For your own documentation, replace the references to kroki.io with your own kroki instance.

Generate the documentation as HTML representation

[source, bash]
----
./dtcw generateHTML
----

Generate the documentation as PDF representation

[source, bash]
----
./dtcw generatePDF
----

Generate the documentation as Microsite

[source, bash]
----
./dtcw generateSite
----
